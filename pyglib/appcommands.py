"""This module is the base for programs that provide multiple commands.

This provides command line tools that have a few shared global flags
followed by a command name followed by command specific flags and
arguments. That is:
  tool [--global_flags] command [--command_flags] [args]

The module is built on top of pyglib.app and 'overrides' a bit of it. Yet
the interface is mostly the same. The main difference is that your main
is supposed to register commands and return without further execution
of the commands. Though pre checking is of course welcome. Also your
global initialization should call appcommands.Run() rather than app.run().

To register commands use AddCmd() or AddCmdFunc(). Where the former is used
for commands that derive from class Cmd and the latter is used to wrap simple
functions.

This module itself registers the command 'help' that allows to retrieve help
for all or specific commands.

Example:

<code>
from pyglib import appcommands
from mx import DateTime


class CmdDate(appcommands.Cmd):
  \"\"\"This docstring contains the help for the date command.\"\"\"

  def Run(self, argv):
    print DateTime.now()


def main(argv):
  appcommands.AddCmd('date', CmdDate)


if __name__ == '__main__':
  appcommands.Run()
</code>

In the above example the name of the registered command on the command line is
'date'. Thus, to get the date you would execute:
  tool date
To get a list of available commands run:
  tool help
For help with a specific command, you would execute:
  tool help date
For help on flags run one of the following:
  tool --help
Note that 'tool --help' gives you information on global flags, just like for
applications that do not use appcommand. Likewise 'tool --helpshort' and the
other help-flags from app.py are also available.

The above example also demonstrates that you only have to call
  appcommands.Run()
and register your commands in main() to initialize your program with appcommands
(and app).

Handling of flags:
  Flags can be registered just as with any other google tool using flags.py.
  But you can also provide command specific flags. To do so simply add a
  flags registering code into the __init__ function of your Cmd classes passing
  parameter flag_values to any flags registering calls. These flags will get
  copied to the global flag list so that once the command is detected they
  behave just like any other flag. That means these flags won't be available
  for other commands. Note that it is possible to register flags with more
  than one command.

Getting help:
  This module activates formatting and wrapping to help output. That is the
  main difference to help created from app.py. So just as app.py appcommands.py
  will create help from the main modules main __doc__. But it adds the new
  'help' command that allows to get a list of all available commands.
  Each commands help will be followed by the registered command specific flags
  along with their defaults and help. After help for all commands there will
  also be a list of all registered global flags with their defaults and help.

  The text for the commands help can best be supplied by overwriting the
  __doc__ property of the Cmd classes for commands registered with AddCmd() or
  the __doc__ property of command functions registered AddCmdFunc().

Inner working:
  This module interacts with app.py by replacing its inner start dispatcher.
  The replacement version basically does the same, registering help flags,
  checking whether help falgs were present and calling the main modules main
  function. However unlike app.py, this module epxpects main() to only register
  commands and then to return. After having all commands registered
  appcommands.py will then parse the remaining arguments for any registered
  command. If one is found it will get executed. Otherwise a short usage info
  will be displayed.

  Each provided command must be an instance of Cmd. If commands get registered
  from global functions using AddCmdFunc() then the helper class _FunctionalCmd
  will be used in the registering process.
